**Key Technologies:**

*   **Runtime:** Bun.js
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **CLI Framework:** commander.js
*   **Email Templating:** MJML
*   **Email Sending:** Nodemailer
*   **Code Formatting and Linting:** Biome

## Building and Running

### Installation

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
bun install
```

### Commands

The following commands are available:

*   **Send an email:**

    ```bash
    bun run index.ts send <mjmlPath> <recipient>
    ```

*   **Preview an email:**

    ```bash
    bun run index.ts preview <mjmlPath> [jsonPath]
    ```

*   **Convert MJML to HTML:**

    ```bash
    bun run index.ts convert <mjmlPath> <outputPath> [jsonPath]
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The project uses Biome for code formatting and linting.
*   **Testing:** The `README.md` file provides a comprehensive guide on how to test the emails generated by this tool. This includes visual testing, functional testing, and technical testing.
*   **Modularity:** The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns. The core logic for MJML conversion and email sending is located in the `src/utils` directory.
